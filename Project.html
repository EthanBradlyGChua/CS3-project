        <h4> World hunger is such a prevalent and important global phenomenon that it affects millions of <br> individuals around the world. It is not just an issue of food shortage, rather, it <br> addresses issues of malnutrition, food supply instability, and lack of access to healthy foods. </h3>
            <h4> <br><br> Prevalence and Statistics In most recent reports by the Food and Agriculture Organization,<br> there are about 690 million people worldwide suffering from hunger as of 2019.  The number is increasing, <br> especially with the COVID-19 pandemic, wars, and climate change. Based on the estimates, <br> however, as at the year 2021, about 811 million people were hunger stricken as a result <br> of extremely increased levels of food insecurity.</h4>
            <h4> <br> <br>One of the dominant causes of hunger is poverty. Many cannot afford enough calories to start with,<br> and low numbers make it impossible to access enough nutritious food. Unemployment, economies <br> decreasing, and low wages have created a cycle that does not allow stability in the region.</h4>
            <h4> <br> <br>  The existence of armed conflict does not allow the production, distribution, or access of food. In <br> conflict zones, the agriculture system is spoilt and worse still, populations are displaced, creating a <br> situation where humanitarian access is very hard. For example, millions are starving in war-torn <br> countries such as Israel that have been happening for years.</h4>
            <h4> <br> <br> An unhealthy diet also affects local populations, especially involving access to wealth,<br>  inequalities in gender and education. Women and ethnic minorities, as well as other <br> disadvantaged groups, encounter particular obstacles that limit their ability to access resources.</h4>
